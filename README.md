# Heroes
Heroes is a lightweight C# framework for event management designed for simple games (providing a base class a script inherits from to call events)

I created this listening to the Sonic Heroes theme song on repeat (thus the name) and thoght it might actually be useful for some later projects.


This should not be used in production code unless you fully understand how it works and are willing to fix bugs. Additionally, the API is subject to change and lacks documentation as of now.
