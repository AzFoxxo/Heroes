# Heroes

Heroes is a lightweight C# framework for event management solution for simple games.

I created this framework originally listening to the Sonic Heroes OST, hence the name. I've used it to create [AzzyShell](https://github.com/AzFoxxo/AzzyShell) and thought someone else may find it useful.

If you wish to help, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue. The code is not yet documented, but I will be working on that once the API is stable.

## Planned Features
- [x] Event Management
- [x] Entity Component System
